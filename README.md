# Instructions

## Summary

Practice as many JavaScript exercises as you can at https://edabit.com/challenges.  Use test-driven development. Do this with the following goals in mind:

    1. Build confidence solving problems with JavaScript code.
    2. Build muscle memory working in TDD.
    3. Identify at least five (5) harder / more complex problems that we can work on together in our next session.

## Preparation

Clone the repository https://github.com/nerdo/tdd-react-calculator-vite and use as a starting point for the exercises.

Put your code in the `src/edabit` directory, using the `hello` example that solves https://edabit.com/challenge/ARr5tA458o2tC9FTN as a guide.

When developing, run `npm test:watch` to start jest in watch mode, so that you will have feedback as you change things.
    
## Do Your Best To Solve Problems Successfully

Start with easier exercises and aim to complete them successfully.

As you work through the exercises, if you are confident that your tests cover everything that the problem is asking for, you should be able to copy and paste your solution to the website and have it succeed the first time around...

But don't be discouraged if you miss anything! That's an opportunity to learn where the holes are in your tests. Go back to your tests, patch them or add new ones to cover the scenario you missed, and iterate on the TDD workflow. Remember: red, green, refactor!

## Fail

Once you get in the groove, look for at least 5 harder problems on the site that we can explore in our next session together. They're categorized by difficulty level on the site and can be filtered using the drop down on the left. See if you find any problems that are particularly interesting to you. The more personal interest you take in the problem, the better.

If you feel up to it and have time to dig in, try solving them on your own with TDD - or maybe even without it.

The goal here is to find some problems that you aren't able to easily solve with TDD... but see how far you can get and we'll discuss and work on them in our next session.
